# Hepatitis Prognostics System with Image Processing

Hepatitis Prognostics System with Image Processing 

A Final Year Minor Project 

B.Tech CSE – Data Science | JNTUH (2022–2025)

This project presents an intelligent system designed for the early detection of Hepatitis using MRI image processing and machine learning algorithms. Hepatitis, a critical liver disease, often goes undetected until severe stages. Our solution combines medical imaging and AI models (CNN, SVM, KNN) to accurately classify liver conditions as either normal or hepatitis-affected.

We preprocess liver MRI images to extract relevant features like texture and intensity using methods like GLCM, histogram analysis, and K-means clustering. A user-friendly GUI, developed using Python's Tkinter, allows users to upload images, select an algorithm, and view predictions.

✅ CNN achieved up to 99–100% accuracy, outperforming traditional diagnostic methods in precision and reliability.

This project bridges the gap between manual diagnosis and tech-driven healthcare, offering a scalable, accurate, and efficient tool for aiding medical professionals in early hepatitis prediction.
